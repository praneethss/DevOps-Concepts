********* Creating ansible roles **********

You can create roles in 2 ways
1. By importing it from ansible galaxy
2. Creating it by ansible-galaxy init

Step 1: Inside the directory /etc/ansible/roles

>> ansible-galaxy init tomcat
This creates the following directory structure
.travis.yml
README.md
defaults/
    main.yml
files/
handlers/
    main.yml
meta/
    main.yml
tasks/
    main.yml
templates/
tests/
    inventory
    test.yml
vars/
    main.yml
    
Step 2: Now add the contents accordingly
 
1. tasks/main.yml - the main list of tasks that the role executes.

2. handlers/main.yml - handlers, which may be used within or outside this role.

3. library/my_module.py - modules, which may be used within this role (see Embedding modules and plugins in roles for more information).

4. defaults/main.yml - default variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information). These variables have the lowest priority of any variables available, and can be easily overridden by any other variable, including inventory variables.

5. vars/main.yml - other variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information).

6. files/main.yml - files that the role deploys.

7. templates/main.yml - templates that the role deploys.

8. meta/main.yml - metadata for the role, including role dependencies.
